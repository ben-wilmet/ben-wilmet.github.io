                <p>Since the success of cms, exploits have been founds, which made a bad reputation of php.</p>
                <p>But <strong>PHP</strong> is still updating, <em>v8.2.24</em> now, and yes many people are still in 5.</p>
                <p><strong>Personnaly</strong>, I think that PHP will keep on be part of the web, as javascript or html.</p>
